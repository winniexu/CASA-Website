	            <li>What is CASA?
		        <p>The Chinese American Student Association is the premier Chinese American organization at UCSD. As a Chinese-interest community, we pride ourselves in providing the most thrilling events, lifelong friends, and sense of Chinese culture. Our philosophy encompasses the union of cultures both Chinese and American that became the unique mixture of western and eastern understanding. Not only do we embrace Asian traditions such as filial respect, Chinese New Years, and close networking among all Asian people, but we also appreciate the openness and independence American culture offers (we love our rom-coms, burgers, and fries!). </p>
		    </li>
	            <li>What does CASA do?
		        <p>We sing; we dance; we play! Many of our events are centered around getting to know members and board members as well as strengthening our friendships and trust for one another. We hold game nights, grab lunch or dinner, and explore San Diego. We volunteer around San Diego as well in order to give back to the community that has given us the opportunity to forge such relationships. </p>
		    </li>
	            <li>When can I join?
		        <p>Whenever! It's never too late or too early to become a CASA member! 
			   We're always looking to welcome new additions to the CASA family.
			   Come out to any general body meeting (GBM) or an event and we will 
			   provide you with the latest CASA <a class="highlight" href="../news/news.html">updates</a>!</p>
		    </li>
	            <li>Do I have to be Chinese to be part of CASA?
		        <p>Absolutely not! We welcome people of all nationalities, ethnicities,
			   and backgrounds. CASA is a 
			   <a class="highlight" href="./aboutCASA.html">bicultural club</a> that brings together
			   students of and interested in the Chinese American heritage.</p>
		    </li>
	            <li>I'm a college student...Do I have to pay?
		        <p>To be affiliated with CASA is cost-free! However, purchasing a
			   <a class="highlight" href="./membership.html">membership card</a> will help us 
			   lower event costs as well as earn you discounts at our paid events
			   and at <a class="highlight" href="../sponsors/sponsors.html">local restaurants!</a></p>
		    </li>
	            <li>What are the time commitments to CASA?
		        <p>There are no mandatory events or meetings for CASA members. 
			   On average, CASA hosts <a class="highlight" href="../events/trips.html">weekly events</a>. 
			   Hope to see you at a meeting or event soon!</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>I still have unanswered questions...who should I contact?
		        <p>You can email us at <a class="highlight" href="mailto:casaucsd@gmail.com?subject=[From: sdcasa.ucsd.edu]">casaucsd@gmail.com</a> or visit our <a class="highlight" href="../contact/contact.html">Contact Us</a> page to send us a message or for more contact info!</p>
