			      <p>This is an introduction sentence about something cool that happened. I have no idea who is going to write this much about an event. But hopefully we can get a blog concept going. Not only will people who missed the event see that our written humor is entertaining but that our events are actually a lot of fun. Additionally, let's have more than one person write these things so it isn't a chore to me or whoever is designated to write these things. Also, that will bring personality to our written descriptions especially since that's what our club is about! Bringing diverse personalities together under a common interest: being or defining Chinese American. Of course, some people who aren't Chinese American will think that they can not identify with us. But that isn't true! All people are welcome! We'll share more of the "American" side with you if you'd like. If you want to learn more about the Chinese half, we can share that with you too. But underneath it all, we're actually as much American as you! We might eat weird foods and choose to intake more carbs in rice than in bread, but we still want to be your friend and we definitely speak decent English! I promise.</p>
			      <p>I initially wanted to write a lot more crap so I could get a pretty good idea how this website would look when we actually do get a worthy event to post on this timeline. Hopefully people actually read this page to get a little taste of Chinese Amurican. We taste like Asian hamburgers. Yeah. I have no idea what I'm saying anymore and this looks like a decent length for a blog post...although I would expect about three paragraphs. But what do you know, sometimes authors have writers block and now I'm going to pretend I do have writers block. Bye.</p> </div>
